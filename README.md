# PRex-Interface Overview
Open source code for the NIH PRex Exoskeleton Graphical User Interface (GUI). Includes shell AVR-C (Arduino) operating system, Python GUI, Unity plotting application, and an MIT App Inventor project (phone app for Android).

All software is protected under the GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPLv3), found in 'LICENSE.md'. 

# System requirements
1. 64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 10, 8
2. 2 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended
3. 2.5 GB hard disk space, SSD recommended
4. 1024x768 minimum screen resolution
5. Python 3.5 or newer

# Software Installation
To implement the GUI 
1. Python: installation link: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (The minimum 3.5 version)
2. Two additional python libraries
   1) pyserial (for serial communication between GUI and exoskeleton): 
      How to install: go to your command prompt and run it as administrator and type: pip install pyserial
   2) pybluez  (for bluetooth communication between GUI and exoskeleton):
      How to install: follow this link to install pybluez: https://pybluez.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
3. Pycharm (python IDE for code development): installation link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
3. Lab Streaming Layer (data synchronization and saving): download link: https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer
4. Unity (for realtime data visualization): download link: https://store.unity.com/download-nuo 

# functionalities of the Python Script

## Step 1. setup communication

## Step 2. data entry functions

The first step is to draw user input from the GUI widgets into a single string, which can ten be sent to Arduino code. The following functions are created to draw the inputs. 
'''
$ construct_data_string_left():..
$ construct_data_string_right():..
$ construct_test_param_string():..
$ construct_gains_string():..
$ construct_pot_string(leg):..
'''

# Important Dependencies:
1. Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)
2. Python Libraries (time, tkinter, os, sys, pylsl, pyserial, subprocess, PyBluez)

After downloading the PRex-GUI folder, add a working copy of pylsl (from Lab Streaming Layer) and a folder containing a working copy of LabRecorder to the folder to make PRex-GUI.py run.
